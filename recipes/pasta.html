    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
      This quick and easy chicken pasta features a creamy sun-dried tomato sauce
      that is dairy- and nut-free thanks to one secret ingredient - cannellini
      beans! It gives the dish creaminess without the need to add extra fat. You
      have to try it!

      </li>
      <li>
        Heat up a nonstick skillet over medium heat. Grease lightly with cooking
        spray. Cook chicken breast for 7 minutes on each side or until internal
        temperature reaches 165°F / 74°C. Let chicken rest for 5 minutes then
        slice into strips. Set aside and keep warm.

    </ol>
    <h4>Pasta</h4>

      <li>Small dice onion and mince garlic.</li>
      <li>
        Heat up the oil reserved from sun-dried tomatoes in the same skillet
        used to cook chicken over medium heat. Add onion and garlic and cook
        until fragrant, stirring constantly, about 10 minutes.
      </li>
      <li>
        Transfer onion, garlic, half of the sun-dried tomatoes, soy milk,
        chicken stock, cannellini beans, oregano and nutritional yeast to a high
        speed blender. Blend until completely smooth.
      </li>
      <li>
        Then, transfer mixture back to skillet. Add the rest of the sun-dried
        tomatoes and bring mixture to a simmer. Season to taste with salt and
        pepper.
      </li>
      <li>
        Meanwhile, cook your spaghetti according to package instructions.
        Reserve about 1 cup of cooking water and drain the rest.
      </li>
      <li>
        Add drained spaghetti to the skillet, toss until everything is evenly
        coated in the sauce. Thin out the sauce as necessary with the pasta
        cooking water.
      </li>
      <li>
        Top pasta with sliced chicken and more black pepper if desired. Enjoy!
